# Model to use for job title mapping
# Supported models:
# - claude-sonnet-4-5 (recommended - fast, accurate, supports structured outputs)
# - claude-opus-4-1 (best quality, slower, more expensive, supports structured outputs)
MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5

# Use structured outputs (beta feature)
# Only works with: claude-sonnet-4-5, claude-opus-4-1
USE_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT=true

# Batch size for processing job titles
# Number of job titles per API request
BATCH_SIZE=200

# Use Message Batches API (async, 50% cheaper)
# Good for large volumes, processes in background
USE_BATCH_API=false

# Max requests per batch job (for parallel processing)
# Lower value = more parallel batch jobs (faster)
# Higher value = fewer batch jobs (better for cache hits)
# Only used when USE_BATCH_API=true
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_BATCH_JOB=1

# Limit number of records (0 = no limit)
# Use for testing before running on full dataset
LIMIT=1000
